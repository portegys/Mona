<h3>Maze-learning Mouse</h3>
</center>
<p>
Train the mouse to find the cheese by clicking out a path through the maze
and selecting train mode a few time. Then test using the test mode. The
real trick is to get the mouse to associate the door it picks from the
start room to know which door to pick at the maze exit room to find the cheese.
To do this, first train all the possible start/end combinations while using
the same maze path. Then train a different maze path by clicking out just
the rooms from entry to exit. Then go back to testing the complete start to goal
paths. You may have to give it a couple of times to get used to the new maze
path. If it succeeds, it means that the knowledge about what to do at the
maze exit is independent of the intermediate task of getting through the
maze itself.
