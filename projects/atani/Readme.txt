This folder contains the Atani project.
An atani is a robotic entity controlled by a Mona neural network.

Requires Microsoft Robotics Studio and Visual Studio 2008 C#.

Install the atani folder in the MSRS root/apps folder.

Build the atani application with VS C# after modifying system-dependent
paths in project files.

Run with VS or using the MSRS dsshost command.

The Mona neural network library files, mona.dll, mona_cs_dll.dll, mona_cs.dll,
and mona.snk, must be in the root/bin folder to run.

Application files are kept in the config folder.
