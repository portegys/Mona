Create a path for the mouse to follow to the cheese by clicking on a sequence of rooms from one of the
start rooms through the maze to one of the cheese goal rooms. Then train the mouse by selecting train
mode and running a few trials. You run a trial by clicking the start trial control which starts the
mouse moving through the rooms. When the mouse finishes moving, click stop trial. When the mouse is
training, it is being shown the correct responses to make in each room. Now use test mode to test the
mouse to see if it can find the cheese on its own!

Now try something interesting! First click reset to make the mouse forget everything.
Then select just one of the start rooms, the entry, exit, and one of the goal rooms. The mouse will
"hop" over the maze. Train that a few times and test the mouse on it.

Now train a path through just the maze by selecting the entry room, three connected maze rooms, and the
exit room. Don't bother to test that now since the mouse didn't find any cheese that would make it want
to do that on its own.

Now comes the tricky part. Combine the paths that you trained separately into one path by selecting all
the rooms from the start to the entry, then through the maze to the exit, then to the cheese goal. Test
the mouse a few times to see if it can find the cheese. You may see it do an extra hop at the entry that
it doesn't need to, but that's OK. If the mouse can find the cheese that means that it can combine things
that it knows together to solve the problem!

You can try other fancy stuff like training more than one start->entry->exit->goal room path, or changing
the maze path while keeping the start->entry->exit->goal room path the same.
